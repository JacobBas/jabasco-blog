## Intro
One thing that I've failed to do in the past is to create some goals to stick to throughout the rest of the year, but now that I have a personal blog I have the perfect medium to document my goals.

## Personal Goals
During the past two years with COVID and a strong focus on career development, my personal development (and maintenance) has taken a backseat. This year I want to make sure that my mental and physical health are at the forefront so that I can build a strong sense of self.

Given that, I have four main goals that I want to focus on:
1. **Workout consistently**: Over the past year I've had recurring lower back problems that I want to make sure I am taking care of as well as focusing on alot more functional strength through calisthenics and non-traditional weightlifting.
2. **Take care of my mental health**: Throughout my career at Allstate I consistently neglected my mental health by overworking, burning out, and a consistent lack of sleep. This was caused by setting poor expectations of myself by coworkers and outweighing career progression over personal health. By setting expectations up front and being more deliberate about separating work and life I hope to start solving this problem.
3. **One new tattoo a month**: I'm a firm believer that if you look good then you feel good and I think tattoos look good. Due to this, I want to treat myself and try to get al least one new tattoo a month given that I have that many ideas.
4. **Learn to bake bread**: I love bread and most of my family and friends love bread so why not learn to bake it! I want to feel comfortable enough baking bread that I have a recipe for any occasion.

## Professional Goals
The start of this year is an exciting one for me given that I am starting a new career in a new industry with a new job title! Starting mid-January I will be transitioning from an Actuary at Allstate Insurance to a Software Engineer at Coalition Inc. and I couldn't be more excited! Given this all the newness of this role, there are alot of things to learn and focus on throughout the year.

### Job Related Goals
1. **Continue to learn more about Python**: While python is not my favorite language, it's value isn't questionable. By continuing to increase my skill with the language will do nothing but benefit me for the future.
2. **Become proficient at Go**: Go is the secondary language used by my new comapny. As such, I want to make sure that I am proficient enough to write high level software within the language.
3. **Gain mentorship in software engineering for coworkers**: This is one of the main things that I was missing at Allstate so being surrounded by so many smart people at my new company will hopefully lead to a ton of learning within the next year.
4. **Understand cyber security**: Since this is my new domain of work I want to make sure that I understand how stuff works.

### Personal Career Goals
1. **Learn Rust**: I want to be comfortable enough in rust that I can write and understand programs, but I definitely don't see it being my primary language.
2. **Machine emulation**: I've never had the will to learn lower level programming topics so by learning emulation I'm hoping to supplement the missing pieces in my knowledge.
3. **Hardware and embedded systems**: Similar to machine emulation, embedded systems is very low level and great knowledge to have. It also has the added benefit of being able to produce physical objects that I can play with which is a plus.
