## Intro
While 2021 was a rough year due to Covid-19, it was also a year of learning and discovery for my professional career. 
One of the discoveries I've made throughout this year is where I want to take my career. I'm deliberately moving away from actuarial science and into the direction of a software engineer. There are many reasons why I don't want to be an actuary anymore:
- Time-consuming and non-applicable exam structure
- Slow internal movement within most actuarial communities
- Pure unenjoyment with actuarial work

With all that in mind, I made the difficult decision of removing myself from the exam process that I've sunk 100's of hours and almost four years into. This was all to focus on learning new technologies and skills that I find much more enjoyment in and can see myself doing for the long term.

## Tech I've Learned
I wanted to focus on the three main parts required to find your way in the software development world: databases, back-end, and front-end. Throughout this year, I had the opportunity to work on all three parts of this stack throughout my personal and professional career while also learning some cool technology.

### Database Technology
While I spent the least amount of time in database work and design, I was still able to learn a ton about the technology and even got some production-level experience designing database architecture. The three databases that I had the chance to work with this year were SQLite, SQL Server, and Postgres.
- **SQLite**: Small but mighty! Throughout this year, it was my go-to for small projects and prototypes. It went a long way in helping me convince my current work to use a database to store information instead of CSV's or Excel files and is still being used within some internal tooling.
- **SQL Server**: While I'm not the biggest fan of SQL Server when your whole company runs on Microsoft product's you can't stay away from it. I'm grateful for the experience of producing production-ready databases within SQL Server that interface with microservices and the suite of Sharepoint technologies that felt like magic to my non-technical coworkers.
- **Postgres**: While I've had an on and off-again relationship with Postgres, this year I decided to make the jump and learn what it is capable of within some of my personal projects. My favorite thing about Postgres is how it can be used as a NoSQL database by using and indexing JSON data.

### Back-end Technology
Back-end development has been the most enjoyable type of development for me. There are so many different problems to solve across so many different domains that it's hard to get bored. Due to this, it can also be hard to keep focused on individual technologies or frameworks which is a problem I struggled with this year. 

While I dabbled in a bit of everything, my proudest achievement has to be my understanding of writing microservices and API's. While I understand the architecture and mental models well enough to implement across languages, I'm most comfortable using Python.
- **Python**: I've had the chance to create a lot of internal tooling that has made a lot of my co-workers' lives easier. Most of this tooling has come down to data transfer protocols but I've also had the chance to work on data analysis and modeling projects with Python. Here are the libraries I've been using: Pandas, Numpy, Flask, Tensorflow, FastAPI.
- **Some other honorable mentions**: Go, Rust, C++, Clojure, Node.js

### Front-end Technology
I have a love-hate relationship with front-end development that is fueled by my lack of design skills. While I thoroughly enjoy edge compute and web technologies, I hate that I have to be the UI designer as well. I don't have the eye for it and I usually get caught up in the look of things.

With that being said, I love writing JavaScript for the browser. It's just so amazing to me the amount of power that the browser has and all of the cool things you can do with such a containerized platform. Browser-based software is the tech that I'm most excited about for the future.

Throughout this year, I've focused on learning two main front-end technologies:
- **JavaScript**: Since this was my first year using JavaScript, I had to start with the basics. I successfully wrote a few personal projects and created internal tooling that leveraged client-side compute at work.  
- **React/Preact**: Preact was an integral part of my tooling stack at work since it had minimal dependencies and increased my output speed due to the ease of use. The componentized nature of React has had a large impact on how I write code moving forward since a modular structure is a good structure.

## Final Thoughts
Throughout this year, I tried to soak up as much diverse information as possible without regard for developing a deep understanding of any one technology. This was the *year of discovery* for me where moving forward I plan to specialize now that I know my interests a bit more fully.
